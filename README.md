# Iraqi Controller Pack
Iraqi Controller Pack | 2018
Welcome to the Iraqi Controller pack! The main sectorfile for controllers in the Baghdad FIR. This controller pack was created from scratch by Chriss Klosowski (1306415). 

## Installation

* Euroscope 3.2 https://www.euroscope.hu/ *required* for plugins to work!
Compatible with the Euroscope radar client only. Not tested with VRC so it may or may not work with VRC.
* Documentation on the TopSky plugin can be found under ......Documents\Euroscope\Iraq-Master\Data\Plugins\TopSky

## Instructions
The controller pack once downloaded from Github will come as Iraq-master.rar extract the folder inside the archive to:
* ……Documents\Euroscope\
Installing it in the correct place will allow the profiles to properly load onto Euroscope. If not you will get errors stating that its not finding the correct directories of the settings, displays etc.. To make sure you’ve installed the Controller Pack correctly this is an example of the Iraqi Profile
* ……Documents\Euroscope\Iraq-master\Iraq.prf
This method is used to double check that this is in the correct directory. If you try to put it outside Documents\Euroscope\ none of the settings or displays as I said previously will work and you will be presented with a black screen with nothing showing up.

1. Open Euroscope and choose a stations pre-confiqured profile.
2. Browse to the folder where you extracted the zip file in step 3 and choose the .prf file for your position that you will control on.
3. Euroscope will open the sector file.
4. For a how-to on using Euroscope, please visit: http://www.euroscope.hu/Docs/EuroScope_in_30_minutes.pdf
